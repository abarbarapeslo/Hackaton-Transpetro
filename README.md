## Description

**Reevo** is a P2P (peer-to-peer) credit fintech platform designed to connect small and medium-sized Brazilian rural producers with individuals interested in investing directly in agribusiness. Using data analysis, AI, and a cloud microservices architecture, our mission is to create a more agile, transparent, and sustainable credit ecosystem.

The complete project documentation, including architecture, flows, and data model, can be found on our Docusaurus site.

### Problem Solved

Brazilian agribusiness faces a paradox: while the sector is a powerhouse, small and medium-sized rural producers suffer from restricted and bureaucratic access to traditional credit. On the other hand, investors seek investment alternatives with impact and transparency. Reevo solves this problem through:

- **Automated credit analysis** to provide quick answers to farmers.
- **Creation of a marketplace** for accessible and transparent investment.
- **Offer of liquidity** for investors through a secondary market.
- **Reduction of bureaucracy** and high fees from traditional intermediaries.

## Reevo Ecosystem

The system operates based on key concepts that ensure its functionality and transparency:

| Concept | Description | Purpose |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **AgroScore** | A credit score (0-1000) generated by AI, which analyzes producer and market data. | To democratize and accelerate risk analysis, offering fairer rates. |
| **CPR** | Cédula de Produtor Rural (Rural Product Bill), the security that formalizes the farmer's loan. | To serve as the base asset for investment, ensuring the legal security of the operation. |
| **Investment Shares (Cotas)** | The CPR is fractionated into small shares (e.g., R$ 100 each), which are the assets bought by investors. | To allow pulverized investment, reducing risk for the investor and facilitating fundraising. |
| **Secondary Market** | Feature that allows investors to sell their shares to other users before the CPR matures. | To provide liquidity, one of the platform's biggest differentials. |

## Key Features
