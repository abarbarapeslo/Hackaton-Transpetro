### Scenario
Sérgio is 41 years old and manages a 32-hectare farm in the Midwest, focused on planting corn and soybeans. He uses his smartphone daily but faces difficulties accessing bank credit due to bureaucracy, collateral requirements, and variable income. He seeks a fairer, faster, and more transparent alternative.

### Journey in 5 Phases

**1. Registration and Application** Sérgio quickly creates his account and initiates a credit request through a guided, simple process.  
**Thought:** “Finally something straightforward, I can do this myself on my phone.”

**2. Didactic Credit Analysis** He receives a clear score (0–1000 and classification A–E), with explanations of positive and negative factors and suggestions for improvement.  
**Thought:** “Now I know what pulled my score down and what I can do to improve.”

**3. Defining Conditions** He chooses the amount, fundraising and grace periods, and payment method. He sees interactive simulations of costs and discounts for early payment.  
**Thought:** “I can adapt the payments to my harvest calendar.”

**4. Fundraising and Receipt** The request is converted into shares on the marketplace. Sérgio tracks the fundraising in real-time and decides whether to accept a partial amount, extend the deadline, or cancel. In the end, he receives the funds.  
**Thought:** “I see clearly how much has been funded; it’s transparent and secure.”

**5. Payment and Relationship** He makes payments via Pix or *boleto* simply. He tracks statements on the dashboard and builds a positive history for future credit requests.  
**Thought:** “I have control of everything in the palm of my hand; I feel valued.”
