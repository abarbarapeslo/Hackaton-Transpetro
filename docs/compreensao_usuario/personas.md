#### Who is Sérgio?
&emsp;Sérgio is 41 years old and a family farmer in the Midwest of Brazil. He manages a 32-hectare farm dedicated to planting corn and soy. He lives in a region with moderate-speed internet access, subject to fluctuations, but he uses his smartphone daily to manage contacts and research information related to production and the market.

#### Challenges
&emsp;Sérgio finds great difficulty accessing bank credit. Bureaucracy, the requirement for collateral, and having a variable income tied to the agricultural cycle put him at a disadvantage compared to traditional financial institutions. Furthermore, he feels frustrated that his serious work and sustainable practices are not recognized.  

#### Goals
&emsp;He seeks faster, more transparent, and digital solutions to finance the purchase of inputs and small machinery. He wants to feel that he has greater control over his financial destiny, being rewarded for the good work he already does. For Sérgio, P2P credit represents a fair alternative, allowing him to grow with adequate rates and in a direct relationship with investors who believe in his potential.
