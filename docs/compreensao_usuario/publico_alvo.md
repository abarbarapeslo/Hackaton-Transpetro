# Target Audience

## Topic Understanding

&emsp;**Reevo** was conceived to connect small and medium-sized farmers with individuals interested in investing directly in the agricultural sector, creating a credit ecosystem that is more agile, transparent, and sustainable. The target audience analysis considers both rural producers demanding financing and investors providing capital, thus ensuring the essential complementarity for the P2P model.

## Family Farmers and Rural Producers

&emsp;The first central group of the target audience is composed of family farmers, young rural individuals, and small to medium-scale agro-entrepreneurs. Many own properties up to 50 hectares and operate in crops such as corn, soy, coffee, dairy, and vegetables. This segment faces significant barriers to accessing formal credit, whether due to bureaucracy, collateral requirements, or income variability tied to the harvest cycle.

&emsp;For medium-sized producers, who represent a relevant portion of national production, the credit need is linked to inputs, small machinery, irrigation technologies, and productive modernization. These farmers value digital solutions that offer speed, more suitable rates, and greater transparency.

According to the 2017 Agricultural Census (IBGE), family farmers represent 77% of rural establishments in Brazil but access less than 15% of formal rural credit.

&emsp;Furthermore, rural cooperatives and associations emerge as strategic players. They consolidate hundreds of producers and can act as channels for acquiring Reevo users, benefiting from the offer of fairer and more agile credit. Data from OCB (2023) indicates that agricultural cooperatives transacted over R\$ 600 billion in 2023, reinforcing their relevance in the sector.

## Individual Investors

&emsp;The other side of the Reevo ecosystem is formed by individuals interested in investing small amounts directly into agricultural operations. This group seeks portfolio diversification, potential returns superior to traditional fixed income, and positive social impact in the rural sector.

&emsp;Among them are local investors, residents of rural areas or small towns, who see Reevo as a way to support the development of their communities. Small and medium-sized urban investors also stand out, attracted by the innovative model, traceability via blockchain, and the clarity of transparent risk models.

According to an ANBIMA report (2023), over 5 million Brazilians already invest outside of savings accounts, and interest in alternatives linked to social impact and ESG grows at annual rates above 20%.
