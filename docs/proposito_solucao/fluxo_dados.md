## Introduction

&emsp;The data flow describes how information and values circulate among the different actors (farmers, investors, and administrators), the platform's internal services, and integrated external systems (e.g., payment gateways, CPR registrars, credit bureaus).

&emsp;These flows were designed considering the personas **Sérgio (Farmer)** and **Marina (Investor)** to ensure the system operates consistently, securely, and transparently, avoiding communication failures and ensuring the traceability of each operation.

&emsp;To represent these interactions, six main flows were elaborated: Credit Request and Approval, Investment Execution, Installment Payment and Distribution (Asynchronous), Secondary Market Sale, Fund Withdrawal (Off-Ramp), and Default Management, each detailing the critical data and integration steps that support the platform's operation.

## Credit Request and Approval Flow

&emsp;This flow describes the journey of the farmer Sérgio from registration until his proposal is listed on the marketplace. It demonstrates the interaction between the user, the automated system, and the "human in the loop" (Credit Analyst).

  Secondary Market Sale Flow

 This flow details how an investor (Marina, the seller) can sell her investment share (Credit Token) to another investor (Carlos, the buyer) before the contract maturity. It is an exchange process within the platform that ensures the secure and atomic transfer of both the share and the USDC value.
