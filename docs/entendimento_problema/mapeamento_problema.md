## Contextualização

&emsp;The **Brazilian agricultural credit** operates in a paradox of high relevance: the agribusiness sector is a national economic engine, but its financing system is marked by **inequality**. The market is dominated by slow and bureaucratic processes that exclude the **Small and Medium Rural Producer (PME)**. The relevance of the theme is crucial, as, despite family farmers representing **77% of rural establishments**, they access **less than 15% of formal credit**.

## Principais Dores e Desafios Identificados

&emsp;The problems critically affect both those who need capital (the Farmer) and those who provide it (the Investor).

### 🧑‍🌾 Pains of the PME Farmer (Sérgio)
* **Restricted and Bureaucratic Access:** Difficulty accessing traditional banks due to excessive collateral requirements and slow processes.
* **Misaligned Credit:** Credit lines do not adapt to the **harvest cycle** (grace period and payments), and risk analysis is opaque.
* **Data Exclusion:** The lack of structured financial data and the undervaluation of assets like the **CAR (Rural Environmental Registry)** in credit analysis.

### 👩‍💻 Pains of the Investor (Marina)
* **Lack of Transparency:** There is no traceability regarding the final use of capital and the real socio-environmental impact of the investment.
* **Asset Illiquidity:** Agribusiness assets (like the CPR) are traditionally long-term and difficult to sell prematurely.
* **Regulatory Complexity:** Difficulty managing tax withholding (IR/IOF) and ensuring the legal compliance of credit titles.

## Causas

&emsp;The above problems originate from structural factors in the credit ecosystem:

* **Outdated Infrastructure:** The formalization of the **CPR** still relies on physical processes or lacks technological standardization (precarious digitization), increasing operational costs.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Traditional banks do not have specialized *scoring* models for Agribusiness (**AgroScore**), resulting in high risk aversion towards PMEs.
* **Lack of Disintermediation:** The credit chain is long, with many intermediaries, which inflates the **Total Effective Cost (CET)** for the producer and reduces the return for the investor.
* **Digital Barrier and Trust:** The producer has low familiarity and high distrust towards new digital channels that are not endorsed by their local network (Cooperatives).

## Consequências da Não-Solução

&emsp;Failure to resolve these problems perpetuates inefficiency and risks in the sector:

* **Financial Exclusion:** Maintenance of **repressed credit** for the majority of producers, limiting modernization and productivity in the field.
* **High Capital Cost:** Credit becomes more expensive for the PME, either due to intermediation *fees* or the need to resort to informal sources.
* **Low Investment Efficiency:** Impact investors cannot allocate capital securely and traceably, undermining the potential of the ESG market in agribusiness.
* **Market Risk:** The lack of transparency and the low liquidity of the asset (CPR)
