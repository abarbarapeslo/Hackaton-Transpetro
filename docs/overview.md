## Introdução

&emsp;**Nautilus** is a digital peer-to-peer (P2P) credit platform that connects small and medium-sized farmers with individual investors interested in portfolio diversification and positive socio-environmental impact.  

&emsp;The project stems from the need to offer more agile, fair, and transparent credit to the agricultural sector, reducing reliance on traditional banks and valuing sustainable practices.

## Problema

&emsp;In Brazil, family farmers represent 77% of rural establishments (IBGE, 2017), but they access less than 15% of formal rural credit. High bureaucracy, collateral requirements, and variable income tied to harvests make bank credit restrictive.

&emsp;Simultaneously, small and medium investors are seeking alternatives beyond traditional fixed income, looking for competitive returns, flexible liquidity, and direct social impact.
