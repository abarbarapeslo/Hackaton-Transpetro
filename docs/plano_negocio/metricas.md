## Contextualization

&emsp;To measure Reevo's success, we will use a combination of **quantitative** indicators (focused on volume and financial health) and **qualitative** indicators (focused on satisfaction and impact), aligned with the Functional Requirements (RFs) and User Journeys (Sérgio and Marina).

## Quantitative Indicators (Performance and Financial)
&emsp;These indicators prove the economic viability and market scale of the platform.

| Indicator | How it will be measured | Goal/Success Parameter |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV)** | Total sum of loans requested and financed (CPR signed) by Farmers over a period. | **Year 1 Goal:** R$ 10 million (Market Validation). **Growth:** Achieve 150% GMV growth in Year 2. |
| **Default Rate** | Percentage of the total loan volume that is past due by more than 90 days (RF-AGR-006). | Maintain below **5%** after the first complete crop cycle, proving the effectiveness of **AgroScore**. |
| **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** | Total investment in marketing/sales divided by the number of new active Farmers and Investors. | Maintain CAC below **15% of the LTV** (Lifetime Value) of the average customer, ensuring scalability. |
| **Reinvestment Rate (Investor)** | Percentage of Investors who reinvest their returns on the platform into a new opportunity in the subsequent month (RF-INV-005). | Greater than **70%**, indicating high satisfaction and confidence in the net yield and impact model. |
| **Average Credit Analysis Time** | Average time (in minutes) from the Farmer's document submission until the AgroScore is generated (RF-AGR-002). | Maintain below **5 minutes** for 98% of requests, proving the speed differential. |
| **Funding Fraction (Marketplace)** | Percentage of loan requests that achieve 100% funding within the stipulated deadline. | Greater than **85%**, ensuring that the Farmer's demand is consistently met. |

## 2. Qualitative Indicators (Satisfaction and Perceived Value)

&emsp;These indicators assess user experience and the intangible impact of the solution.

| Indicator | How it will be measured | Goal/Success Parameter |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** | Quick survey from 0 to 10 asking users the likelihood of recommending Reevo to a friend/colleague. | **NPS** above **50**, indicating high loyalty and satisfaction (especially after the first funding/investment). |
| **Journey Completion Rate** | Percentage of users who start registration (RF-CAD-001) and complete it, or who start a loan request and finalize it (RF-AGR-001). | **Onboarding completion rate** greater than **80%**, reflecting the platform's usability. |
| **Legal Compliance Feedback** | Collection of *feedback* from Registry Offices regarding the acceptance and registration process of the **Digital CPR (ICP-Brasil)**. | **Zero rejections** of the digital CPR due to non-compliance, proving the legal robustness of the solution (RF-AGR-003). |
| **Engagement with Impact Reports** | Number of Investors who access or download the **Impact Reports (RF-INV-007)** monthly. | More than **50%** of active Investors accessing the reports, validating the value of the ESG differential. |
