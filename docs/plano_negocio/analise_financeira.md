## Contextualization

&emsp; This section consolidates the viability analysis of Reevo, translating the financial, architectural, and risk results into a Strategic Action Plan.

## Project & Product Description

* **Product / Service:** Hybrid **P2P Platform** to originate agricultural credit (tokenized CPR) for rural SMEs, with risk analysis via **AgroScore** (AI) and liquidity guarantee via the **Secondary Market**.
* **Value Proposition:** Democratization of credit to the SME Farmer, with faster analysis than traditional credit models and the offer of an asset with **liquidity** and **ESG compliance** to the Investor.
* **Target Clients:** **SME Farmers** and **Individual/Impact Investors**.
* **Stage:** **Seed** (Launch and Market Validation).

## Key Assumptions

| Assumption | Value | Source / Justification |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| Average Ticket (TM) per Operation | **R$ 40,000** | Benchmark for credit to SMEs/Family Farming. |
| Average Origination Fee | **3.0%** | Competitive average in the *AgriTech* market. |
| Average Performance Fee | **18%** | High margin, aligned with P2P risk average (RF-TAX). |
| Default Rate (Year 1) | **8.0%** | Initial startup risk, dropping to **4.5%** in Year 3 due to AgroScore effectiveness. |
| Active Clients (Farmers) / Month (Year 1) | **35** | Ramp-up target via partnerships (420 operations/year). |
| Average CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) | **R$ 2,000** | High cost due to assisted onboarding and Cooperatives partnerships. |
| Monthly Investor Churn | **1.5%** | Low, justified by **Secondary Market** liquidity and **Staking (Token SEED)**. |
| Discount Rate (DCF) | **12%** | High-risk startup standard in a regulated sector. |

---

## TAM (Total Addressable Market)

Reevo targets the **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)** of **R\$ 50 billion** annually, which represents the unmet credit volume for SMEs and Family Farming.

* **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):** The adoption target is to reach **R\$ 50 million** in GMV in Year 3 $\approx$ 0.1% of SAM.
* **Traction:** The projected GMV growth rate is 150% (Year 2) and 100% (Year 3), driven by offering liquidity to investors and the trust from partnerships and distribution models for investors and farmers.

## Revenue Model

The model is ***fee-based***, with the risk of *default* directly impacting the **Performance Revenue**.

### Unit Economics

Calculated with TM of R\$ 40,000 and Interest Return of 20%.

| Metric | Calculation / Value | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LTV (Lifetime Value) per Client (3 years)** | R$40,000X3%+(R$ 40,000×20%×18%×3)⟹R$5,520| (Total present value generated by the client). |
| **LTV / CAC** | R$ 5,520 / R$ 2,000 => **2.76x** | Must be optimized to exceed 3.0x (scalability goal). |
| **CAC Payback** | CAC / (Average Monthly Revenue) $≈$ **9 months** | Time to recover the acquisition investment. |

## Cost Structure

Costs are dominated by **Technology (TechOps)** and **Compliance (Legal/Security)**, not by *funding*.

| Category | Type | Annual Projection (Year 1) | Key Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Salaries (Tech/Ops)** | OPEX Fixed | R$ 500,000 | Dev/Blockchain Senior and Backoffice/Support Analyst. |
| **Infrastructure & Compliance** | OPEX Fixed | R$ 270,000 | Hosting, ICP-Brasil, HSM, and Smart Contracts Audit. |
| **Marketing & Sales (CAC)** | OPEX Variable | R$ 840,000 | Cost to acquire 420 Farmers $\times$ R\$ 2,000 (CAC). |
| **CAPEX (Initial Investment)** | CAPEX | R\$ 500,000 | Development of the **Score Engine (ML)** and *Smart Contracts*. |

## Projected Cash Flow (Year 1–5)

The FCF (Free Cash Flow) negative shows the need for initial capital.

| Metric | Year 1 (R\$k) | Year 2 (R\$k) | Year 3 (R\$k) | Year 4 (R\$k) | Year 5 (R\$k) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **EBITDA** | (1,790) | (1,500) | (850) | 400 | 1,500 |
| **CapEx** | (500) | (300) | (400) | (400) | (500) |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCF)** | **(2,240)** | **(1,800)** | **(1,250)** | **(0)** | **800** |

## Scenarios

Simulation with the variation of the main risk factor: the **Default Rate**.

| Scenario | Default Rate (Year 3) | EBITDA (Year 3) | Cash Flow (Year 3) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base** | **4.5%** | **(R\$ 850)** | **(R\$ 1,250)** |
| **Pessimistic** | **6.5%** (AgroScore Failure) | (R\$ 1,850) | (R\$ 2,250) |
| **Optimistic** | **3.0%** (AgroScore Excellent) | R\$ 550 | R\$ 150 |

## Sensitivity Analysis

Impact of 20% variations in critical variables (Year 3).

| Variation | Variable | Impact on NPV @12% (Year 5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **+20%** | Origination Fee | **+R\$ 1.5M** |
| **-20%** | Default Rate | **+R\$ 1.2M** |
| **-20%** | CAC | **+R\$ 1.0M** |

## Break-even and Payback

* **Break-Even Point:** Reevo reaches **Operational Break-Even** ($>= 0$) in **Year 4** of the base scenario.
* **Payback Period (Cumulative FCF):** The initial capital will be recovered (Cumulative FCF $>= 0$) in approximately **4.5 years**.
