## Contextualization

&emsp; Reevo requires a **hybrid distribution strategy**, combining the scale of digital channels with the capillarity and trust of rural relationships. Distribution will be segmented to address the platform's two distinct customer audiences — the farmer and the investor — focusing on where each seeks information and trust. Reevo's positioning in the market must be consistent, communicating **technological security, credit agility**, and **return with impact**.

### Product 

&emsp; The product is **P2P digital credit for the agribusiness sector**, focused on cutting bureaucracy and ensuring security.

* **Central Differential:** **AgroScore** (fast risk analysis) + **Digital CPR (ICP-Brasil)** + **Tokenization/Blockchain** for traceability and security.
* **Value for the Farmer:** Speed in approval and flexibility in payment, adapted to the agricultural cycle.
* **Value for the Investor:** Liquidity via the **Secondary Market**, total asset transparency, and **Impact Reports** (RF-INV-007).
* **Guarantee:** Regulatory compliance with automatic tax withholding (RF-TAX-002).

### Price 

&emsp; The model is based on **fee-based monetization**, ensuring Reevo earns from the success and volume of transactions.

* **Origination Fee (RF-TAX-001):** Percentage charged to the **Farmer** on the total loan amount, covering validation and technology costs.
* **Performance Fee (RF-TAX-001):** Percentage charged to **Investors** on the return (interest) generated by the asset, aligning platform success with investment success.
* **Transaction Fee (RF-INV-003):** Small *fee* charged on the negotiation of shares in the **Secondary Market**, ensuring revenue from liquidity.
* **Strategy:** Maintain the **Total Effective Cost (CET)** for the Farmer competitive compared to traditional banks, even incorporating the Origination Fee and the IOF (Brazilian Financial Transaction Tax).

### Place (Distribution)

| Audience | Primary Channel | Objective |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Farmer** | **Cooperatives, Input Resellers, and API for Local Agents.** | Use of **trusted channels** to overcome the digital adoption barrier. |
| **Investor** | **Platform and Digital Financial Media (ESG).** | Targeting the **digital and impact-focused** profile, where traceability is a key differential. |

### Promotion (Communication and Engagement)

&emsp; Promotion must focus on demystifying P2P credit and highlighting the security and agility of the platform.

* **For the Farmer:**
    * **Localized Content Marketing:** Focus on tutorials and short videos that show the **Credit Analysis in 60 Seconds** process and the ease of **signing the CPR via mobile**.
    * **Agricultural Events and Fairs:** Presence at regional events, with practical demonstrations of the AgroScore.
    * **Notification Triggers (RF-COM-001):** Automatic, clear, and immediate communication about the request *status* to reinforce transparency.
* **For the Investor:**
    * **Performance and Impact Campaigns:** Advertising in financial media with an emphasis on **net return** and the social impact of investments (support for family farming).
    * **Proofs of Security and Compliance:** Open communication about the audit of **Smart Contracts** and the legal validity of the Digital CPR.
    * **Reinvestment Program:** Incentive for the Investor to **reinvest** profits, activated by **notifications (RF-COM-002)** and personalized suggestions.
