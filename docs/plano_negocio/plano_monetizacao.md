title: Monetization Plan
---

## Contextualization

&emsp;The Reevo monetization plan is a **hybrid fee-based model**, designed to generate revenue from both sides of the ecosystem (Farmer and Investor), ensuring sustainability and alignment with the success of credit operations.

## Revenue Streams

&emsp;Revenue streams are derived from the Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), as defined in the Functional Requirements (RF-TAX-001), and the offering of value-added services.

| Source | Description | Strategic Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Origination Fee (RF-TAX-001)** | Charge on the value of each credit operation originated. | Ensures revenue with each concession, covering CAC and the costs of *onboarding* and **AgroScore**. |
| **Performance Fee (RF-TAX-001)** | Percentage on interest received by investors for each installment paid. | Links revenue to the profitability and recurrence of operations. |
| **Marketplace Fee (RF-INV-003)** | Fixed commission per operation for selling/buying credit shares in the **Secondary Market**. | Boosts revenue as platform **liquidity** grows, a value-added service for the Investor (Marina). |

## 2. Pricing Model

&emsp;The pricing model is based on percentage commission, adjusted to risk and market conditions.

| Product/Service | Pricing | Rationale and Competitiveness |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Credit Origination** | **2% to 4%** of the granted value (variable based on **AgroScore** risk). | Allows competitiveness against banks and *fintechs*, while risk variation encourages the producer to improve their score. |
| **Performance** | **15% to 20%** on gross interest received by the Investor. | Ensures a high margin for the platform and keeps the Investor's **Net Return** attractive compared to fixed income. |
| **Marketplace Transaction** | **1% to 1.5%** of the transaction value in the Secondary Market. | Low enough fee to stimulate liquidity without burdening the Investor. |

&emsp;The Reevo revenue model mixes **transactional fees and subscriptions**, optimizing adoption for both B2C (Farmer/Individual Investor) and B2B (Cooperatives), and is aligned with the margins and *benchmarks* of P2P platforms and credit *fintechs*.

## 3. Revenue Growth Projection

&emsp;Revenue growth is directly tied to the increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) and the stabilization of the *default rate* (inadimplência).

| Horizon | Strategic Focus | Key Milestone |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Short Term (Year 1)** | Focus on platform validation and **AgroScore** stabilization. Revenue dominated by the **Origination Fee**. | **Break-Even Point:** Reached between **8 and 12 months** of operation, proving the sustainability of the model with initial volume. |
| **Medium Term (Year 2-3)** | **GMV Scaling** (growth >100%), Increase in **Performance Fee** revenue. | **Consistent Profitability and Scalability:** Proving the ability to scale without increasing the *default rate*, generating **positive ROI** and attracting Series A investment. |
| **Long Term (Year 5+)** | Diversification into new financial products indexed to ESG impact data and advanced *analytics*. | **Market Leadership:** Positioning as the main P2P digital credit *player* for rural SMEs, with high contribution margin. |

## 4. Financial Risks and Mitigations
&emsp;The sustainability of Reevo depends on the effective management of risks inherent to P2P credit and fintech operations. The main risks that can impact the cash flow and profitability of the project are detailed below, along with mitigation strategies integrated into the platform to ensure its stability and growth.

| Financial Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lower than expected adoption (low GMV)** | **Strategic Partnerships:** Use Cooperatives and Input Resellers for farmer access and ESG channels for Investors. |
| **Margin reduction due to competition** | **Continuous Innovation:** Maintain technological differentiation (**AgroScore** and **Secondary Market**) and the high value added by **integrated tax compliance**. |
| **Default Risk Reduces Performance Revenue** | **Risk Governance:** Continuous refinement of the **AgroScore** based on real data and automated collection management. |
| **Operational/Regulatory Risk** | **Proactive Compliance:** External audit of Smart Contracts and transparent tax reporting (RF-TAX-002) to avoid fines and interruptions. |
