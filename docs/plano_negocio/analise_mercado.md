## Contextualization

&emsp; Market Analysis is a fundamental step for understanding the environment in which a product or service will be introduced, allowing for the identification of opportunities, challenges, and consumer behavior. 

## Sector Overview

&emsp; Currently, Brazil has consolidated itself as one of the main global agricultural powers, with a history of expanding frontiers and continuously increasing field productivity. This reality **demands a massive volume of financing for agribusiness**, which is divided into working capital credit (purchase of inputs, raw materials), investment credit (acquisition of equipment such as tractors and storage), and commercialization credit.

&emsp; Despite this demand, the Brazilian rural credit market exhibits **significant structural inefficiency**, caused by its **strong dependence on traditional, bureaucratic, and segmented systems**, which historically favor large producers to the detriment of a vast contingent of Small and Medium Producers (PMEs). Although the sector moves **over R$1 trillion annually**, the fragility in credit distribution and the estimated deficit — **especially among PMEs** — create a **substantial opportunity for new credit models**.

## Market Trends

&emsp; The rural credit market in Brazil is robust and essential for the dynamism of agribusiness, one of the key sectors of the national economy. In 2024, the total applied in rural credit, covering working capital, investment, and commercialization, reached approximately R$ 330.9 billion, a value that represents only a fraction of the ideal financing need, estimated at around R$ 900 billion. This gap **evidences a significant deficit**, especially for **small and medium-sized producers**, who **face difficulties accessing traditional credit** due to **bureaucratic barriers and lack of collateral**.

&emsp; Plano Safra 2025/2026, the largest to date, made R$ 516.2 billion available to the sector, expanding credit supply and maintaining subsidized interest rates below market levels. Resources are divided between controlled lines, which include government subsidies and feature lower interest, and free lines, whose cost is closer to the market. Despite the expressive increase in subsidized resources, effective disbursement and liquidity still face challenges, with seasonal and regional variations sensitive to economic and climatic performance.

&emsp; In parallel, **the private and digital financing market has been growing rapidly**. **Fintech platforms and peer-to-peer (P2P) models are gaining ground,** offering agility, financial inclusion, and transparency, especially for those not served by the traditional system. The expansion of these digital solutions is driven by the digitalization of processes, integration of public and private data, and the growing interest of investors in financial products linked to agribusiness, especially within **ESG** premises.

## Competitor Analysis

### Credit Models in Agribusiness

**Traditional Credit**

&emsp; The Traditional model is primarily provided by **public and private banks**, cooperatives, and government programs like Pronaf, Pronamp, and BNDES lines. It is based on classic financial analysis, **demands real collateral (land, machinery, harvest), strong bureaucracy, and long release periods**. It presents high volume and reach for large producers but has **low inclusion of small and medium producers** due to **difficulties in access**.

:::info
Data from ITT Brasil indicates that **only 15% of total agricultural financing** offered by traditional banks is distributed among **85% of family farmers**.

**Structured Private Market**

&emsp; The structured private market has been gaining relevance rapidly. It consists of **specialized funds**, such as FIAGRO and FIDC, which offer resources to finance large operations, mainly through the securitization of rural receivables. These players are strong in fundraising and have the backing of institutional investors, ensuring security and scale for medium and large operations. However, it **limits access for small producers, with high dependence on the quality and volume of receivables and the manager's operational capacity**.

**P2P Model**

&emsp; The P2P market has gained prominence through digital platforms that promote **peer-to-peer loans** with **risk analysis based on alternative data**. This model facilitates credit access for PMEs and small farmers, offering fractional investments to individual investors. They present **strong potential for growth and innovation**, but are still limited in scale and fundraising compared to the traditional market.

### Benchmarking
&emsp; Below is a **comparative analysis of the main platforms and financing models within the Brazilian rural credit market** that **compete directly or indirectly with the project**. It will explore the positioning, target audience, competitive advantages, and challenges faced by each player, allowing for an understanding of the nuances between traditional modalities, consolidated institutions, and innovative digital solutions that implement peer-to-peer credit models, asset tokenization, and intelligent technologies within the sector. This analysis is fundamental for **identifying opportunities for differentiation and viability against the competition**.
